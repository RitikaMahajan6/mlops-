The file /mlops-project/mlops-project/models/model.pkl is a binary file that contains the serialized trained model. As such, it cannot be represented in a text format. You would typically generate this file by running the model training script, which saves the trained model to this location.

Therefore, the contents of the file are intentionally left blank.
