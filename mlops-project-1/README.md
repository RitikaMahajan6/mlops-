# MLOps Project

This project is designed to implement a machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline that encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to provide a structured approach to developing and maintaining machine learning models.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mlops-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the pipeline:**
   You can execute the entire MLOps pipeline using the provided shell script:
   ```
   bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh
   ```

## Usage

- Use the `notebooks/exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb` for initial data exploration and visualization.
- Modify `src/data_preprocessing.py` to customize data loading and preprocessing steps.
- Adjust `src/model_training.py` for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate the model performance using `src/model_evaluation.py`.

## Components

- **Data:** Raw and processed data directories for managing datasets.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- **Source Code:** Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Models:** Directory to store the trained model.
- **Scripts:** Automation scripts for running the entire pipeline.
- **Requirements:** List of dependencies required for the project.
- **Docker:** Containerization setup for consistent environment.
